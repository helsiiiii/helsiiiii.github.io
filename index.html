		<p>I love animals, so I’ve got a lot of them. Someone’s hobby is collecting stamps, doing exercises, drawing or learning foreign languages. Animals are my hobby. I like to look after them, feed and just watch them. I believe that animals bring us happiness and positive emotions. This, in its turn, has a positive effect on our moral and psychological state. </p>
		<p>So let me tell you more about my pets. In my house you will find two dogs and one cat, aquarium with fish and two hamsters. Most of all I love dogs, but my mom loves cats. My brother is a very reserved person by character, so he keeps fish, but my sister loves hamsters. As for dad, his love is sufficient for all the animals. He, just like me, doesn’t mind playing with any pet in our house.</p>
